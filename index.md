# YEP - Yellow Fever Epidemic Prevention
 A package for running a dynamic SEIRV model of yellow fever, including generating sets of annual epidemiological data (annual reported severe and fatal case data, seroprevalence data). The package can also be used to fit values of epidemiological parameters of the model to different types of data on yellow fever burden in one or more regions.

For a more detailed overview of the purpose and uses of the package, please read the Introduction article (TBA).

Additional packages ([YellowFeverDynamics](https://github.com/mrc-ide/YellowFeverDynamics) and [YFDaux](https://github.com/mrc-ide/YFDaux)) provide additional functions for running alternative versions of the model and carrying out more specialized tasks (YellowFeverDynamics) and processing model output (YFDaux).

These packages are all currently under construction/overhaul.
