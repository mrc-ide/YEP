\arguments{
\item{model_data}{SEIRV output of Model_Run and similar functions}

\item{p_severe_inf}{Probability of an infection being severe}

\item{p_death_severe_inf}{Probability of a severe infection resulting in death}

\item{p_rep_severe}{Probability of reporting of a severe but non-fatal infection}

\item{p_rep_death}{Probability of reporting of a fatal infection}

\item{output_type}{Type of output to produce:
"annual" - Total reported cases and reported deaths by year
"pts" - Total reported cases and reported deaths for every time point, summed over age groups
"full" - Reported cases and reported deaths for every time point and age group}

\item{deterministic}{Indicates whether to calculate results deterministically (TRUE) or stochastically (FALSE)
