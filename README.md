A package for running a dynamic, deterministic SEIRV model of yellow fever, creating input data and processing output data.

The package can also be used to fit values of epidemiological parameters of the model to different types of data on yellow fever burden in one or more regions.

The package containing the stochastic version of this model can be found at:
