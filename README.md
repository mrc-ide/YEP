# YEP - Yellow Fever Epidemic Prevention

A package for running a dynamic SEIRV model of yellow fever, creating input data and processing output data.

The package can also be used to:

-Generate datasets based on existing yellow fever epidemiological datasets (annual reported case data and seroprevalence survey results).

-Estimate values of epidemiological parameters of the model and other parameters including vaccine efficacy and case reporting rates, based on epidemiological data on yellow fever burden from one or more regions.

-Generate yellow fever burden data for multiple countries based on the approach used by the [Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium](https://www.vaccineimpact.org).

Additional packages for use with this package:

[YEPaux](https://github.com/mrc-ide/YEPaux): Auxiliary functions for processing model output and parameter estimation results

[YellowFeverDynamics](https://github.com/mrc-ide/YellowFeverDynamics): Alternate versions of the basic model and additional functions for outbreak risk estimation and response modelling
